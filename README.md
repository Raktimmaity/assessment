Subject: Fixing Monsoon ROAS Drop – Safe Delivery Solution

Hi User,

We have identified three key reasons why your Google Ads ROAS drops during monsoons. The main reasons are delivery fears, mobile network issues, and seasonal interest shifts.

So, after that what is our Solution? So, We built a Monsoon Special Landing Page with a Rainproof Jewelry Guarantee, trust-based messaging, and a floating customer review badge to boost conversions.

Additionally, we’ll run an A/B test comparing urgency-based messaging (Limited stock!) vs. assurance-based (Safe delivery guaranteed!).

Let’s discuss further!

Best Regards,
<br>
